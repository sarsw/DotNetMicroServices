I followed this https://youtu.be/DgVjEo3OGBI in its entirety.

This tutorial uses a simple database with a C# api scenerio to introduce:

Kubernetes (K8S),
Nginx,
Microservices,
Docker / Dockerhub,
MS SQL,
REST API,
RabbitMQ,
gRPC and
Entityframework Core

Tooling:
VS Code,
MSSQL Management Studio,
Postman (& some Insomnia) and 
Docker desktop (with K8S)

Highly recommended. 

I had EF install issues so had to downgrade to the versions used in the YT video.  All other refs were the latest at the time and you can see them in the appropriate .csproj file.
My commit messages document the progress and commands used to achieve each stage.  The attached images show the archtitecture and example tool usage.
